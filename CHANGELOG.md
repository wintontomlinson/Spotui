# Spotui: Fork Features & Differences

This document outlines the custom features, improvements, and differences introduced in this fork
compared to the main Spotui repository.

---

## 🚀 Release v1.6.0

### 🛠 Playback Fixes

* **Songs no longer stop halfway:** a stream that was cut short was reported to the player as a
  normal end of track, so the queue advanced mid song. Worse, the cache stored that early end as
  the length of the track, which made the same song stop at the same point on every later play.
  Short responses are now reconnected from the exact byte offset already played, the cache can no
  longer record a truncated length, and the media cache directory was versioned so entries poisoned
  by older builds are dropped.
* **Errors retry instead of skipping:** a dropped connection used to jump straight to the next song.
  The current track is now re-resolved and resumed from where the audio stopped, and the queue only
  advances when the track genuinely cannot play.

### 🎨 Identity

* **New launcher icon:** an amber plate with a dark five bar waveform, replacing the previous dark
  plate and music note. Adaptive, round, themed monochrome and Play Store variants are all
  generated from the same mark by `tools/generate_launcher_icons.py`.

  SoundCloud based on provider priority.

  YouTube Music remains fallback).
* **Cache Resets:** Per-song "Invalidate cache" player menu option and global cache reset for stream
  overrides.

* **Accurate Resolution Logs:** Trace logs report whether playback originates from memory, disk
  cache, or offline downloads.
