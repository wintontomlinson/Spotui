# Spotui: Fork Features & Differences

This document outlines the custom features, improvements, and differences introduced in this fork
compared to the main Spotui repository.

---

## 👑 Royal Edition

### 🎨 Royal premium theme

* **New palette:** Deep royal-purple canvas (`#130824`) with royal-gold accents (`#D4AF37`),
  replacing the old near-black background and blue accent.
* **Deterministic look:** Wallpaper-derived dynamic colour is now off by default so the premium
  royal-purple/gold theme is consistent across devices.
* **Accent sweep:** The Spotify-green highlights across every screen were re-tinted to royal gold.

### 🔁 Smarter auto-queue (related songs)

* Autoplay radio now tops up the queue **earlier** (4 tracks before the end, up from ~1) and seeds
  from the last **8** tracks, so related songs are always appended automatically and playback never
  stalls waiting on a fetch.

### 🏠 Trending, refreshable Home

* **Pull-to-refresh** on Home re-fetches the feed (bypassing the cache).
* **Trending rotation:** "Trending / Charts / Popular / New" shelves float to the top and the
  remaining shelves rotate on a time bucket, so Home changes over time instead of showing the same
  order every visit.

### 🧭 Redesigned Explore

* Image-forward Browse tiles: full-bleed artwork with a royal gradient scrim and a gold hairline,
  taller cards, and a royal-purple/gold category palette led by **Trending** and **Charts**.

### 🧹 Cleanup

* Removed a stray 2,666-line out-of-tree copy of AndroidX's `MediaSession.java` that was not part of
  any build source set.
